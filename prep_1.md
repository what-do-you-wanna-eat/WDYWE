# Cooperation Plan

Key Strengths of Each Team Member/Professional competencies we’d want to improve on: 

Chris: Creative, communicative, likes to contribute to discussions/greater good! Wants to get better at problem solving.

Ezgi: Proofreading, debugging, thorough, good at explaining JS; Wants to develop collaboration and communication. 
Andra: Grasp concepts, communicative, wants to get better at problem solving/coding concepts; wants to get better at teaching/explaining code.

How can you best utilize each person’s strength in the execution of the project? 

As a group, we feel like our strengths compliment each other. Equally ready to contribute to the project! 

How do you plan to approach day to day work?

Check in, have daily stand up
Code review
Delegate tasks for the day, assess whether we want to:
Pair program?
Mob programming?
Solo program?
Set deadlines for when certain tasks should be done.
Once MVP is established, figure out benchmarkers for the project.
Setting hours aside for when we’re able to work. Anytime help is needed outside of those hours, as if anyone has the capacity/availability to help.

# Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Reach out to Adam to help with any mediating, if necessary.
Make sure everyone understands what their responsibilities are, and asking for help when needed. 
Open communication!

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

Check in about everyone’s responsibilities; adjust if necessary.
Ask for mediation, if needed.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Utilize each person’s strengths– if one person is better at something, they can mentor another person in that skill.
If we are able to, and it’s needed, we can pull in a TA and all learn how to solve the same issue.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Check in about the person’s responsibilities, either in a group or one-on-one setting. Whichever is more appropriate. 
Offering help if someone is having a tough time. Meet them where they are.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If member is unresponsive/not communicating/ghosting
Escalate the situation in the case we are nearing a set deadline. Want to keep the group on track to reach MVP.

How often will you take breaks? 

Every hour, 10min., 1 hour lunch break on long days.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind? 

Assess the situation: evenly redistribute the workload if one person is further along, reach out to Adam or another TA if we need help figuring out how to approach the project.

Strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

Have group members slack any questions/concerns/items they’d like to bring up in the group. Agenda items for stand ups/check ins.
Let everyone have an opinion on something; consensus decision-making.

How will you ensure you’re creating a safe environment for everyone to speak up?

Being present and intentional with the group– noticing if people are having an off day/not commenting/mindfully checking in with them.
Emotional intelligence

# Work Plan

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Identify and assign based off of individual strengths and capacity, work off of our timeline to divvy out tasks, utilize daily check-ins to ensure we’re staying on track.

What project management tool will be used?

Continuing to research this topic– not sure what tool we will be using yet.

# Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
Describe at least:
What components of your project will live on GitHub?

HTML, Javascript, CSS

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

Create organization, add teammates

What is your Git flow?

Create dev and feature branches as needed. Commit after every working change. Merge intermittently to main branch with no buggy code, only working code. 

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?

Yes we will be using PR reviews– at least 1 person should review and accept.

Who merges PRs?

Ezgi! 

How often will you merge?

Merge feature branch into dev branch when a task is complete, merge dev branch into main branch when code is perfect.

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

Use one of our above listed communication methods to confirm.
