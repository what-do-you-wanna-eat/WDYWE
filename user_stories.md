# User Stories for group project

- User stories are a device commonly used in software development to identify what the functionality and design of a proudct should be by considering the interests and motivations of people with varied multiple points of view. It allows a client to communicate to a team what type of behavior they are looking for, and allow the team to think up a solution that best fits the clients need.

*Create five user stories for your approved project. Each story in your project management board should contain: title, user story sentence, feature tasks, acceptance tests.*

## Saving Items

- As a user, I want to save the restaurants so that I can view them later.

- Code restaurants as objects, and save them to local storage when a user favorites them. Create a page where they can see their favorites.

- Checking local storage.

## Generating recommendations

- As a user, I want help deciding what I want to eat so that I don't have to think about it.

- Code a website that takes in user preferences and generates restaurant recommendations based on them. Create forms in HTML with scroll-down options where users can select preferences. We will create an array with all of the objects in the preferences menu. The code will return the restaurants that have the selected preferences in the array.

- Use live server loading and test it out.

## Accessing location

- As a user, I want to get the address of the restaurant I'm buying food from so that I know where to go.

- Code restaurants as objects, with addresses as properties. Once a restaurant has been selected, the user can access all properties, address included.

- `console.log()` & live server reload.

- Stretch Goal: Instead of showing address, show google map image with information/location.

## Accessibility & ease of use

- As a user, I want an approachable, easy to use application so that I'm not struggling figuring out how it works.

- Write DRY, clean code with cohesive, easy to understand structure and user output. Utilize CSS to create accessible layout.

- "Break" images to ensure accessible image descriptions work, use the applications ourselves to make sure it's easy to use.

## User food preferences

- As a user, I want an application that includes my dietary restrictions in it's implementation so that I can also access cool restaurants.

- We would research local restaurants and include those that actually accomodate for dietary restrictions/preferences in our object properties. Would also list these preferences in our HTML form.

- Make sure form works and displays accurate information. Test to see if the correct restaurants show up when we make those selections.
